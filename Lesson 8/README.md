Experimen 8 â€“ Memory Game

Design a memory game. For this, a main form screen opens and there is a start game button on 
the main form. When the button is clicked, 2 different forms will open (2 users). In these opened 
forms, 3 different symbols are displayed in a rectangular area with random numbers and random 
coordinates. After the defined time has expired (e.g. 5 seconds), these symbols disappear from 
the form. The user tries to guess the numbers of the symbols. Enters estimated values into the 
textbox field. Either the form1 user or the form2 user gets the score, depending on their distance 
from the predicted value.

Checkpoints

1. Creating the main form screen and adding the "Start Game" button.
2. When you click on the "Start Game" button, 2 different forms will open.
3. Creating a rectangular area in both forms and displaying symbols in random numbers and 
random coordinates in this area. Different coordinates and symbols will be created for each form.
You can use the PictureBox control for this.
4. Using a timer so that the symbols disappear after a certain period of time (Timer).
5. Adding a TextBox in both forms for the user to guess the symbols.
6. Calculating points according to the numbers entered by the user and displaying them on the 
main form.
