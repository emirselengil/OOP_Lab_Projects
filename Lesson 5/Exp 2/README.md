Experiment 2 â€“ ComboBox Configuration

Create a "shoe ordering system". The user will be able to create an order via this screen. User 
enters name-surname and phone information into TextBox fields. Selects a model from the shoe 
brand models listed in the ListBox. Selects the number information via CheckBox. Then he/she 
selects the province and the district affiliated with the chosen one. When you click on the "Create 
Order" button, the order created on the ListBox is displayed.
