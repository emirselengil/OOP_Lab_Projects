Experiment

Create “Hangman” game. Two forms will be created for the user. In the first form, the user will 
switch to the game screen by saying "Start". On the screen that opens, the user must try to guess 
by entering letters in the TextBox field. The hangman image should be updated with every wrong 
guess. For each wrong guess, -10 p is applied and the point value (with label) is shown on the 
screen. When the user loses or wins the game, a warning should be displayed with the 
MessageBox. With the "End Game" button, the user must end the game and close the form 
screen, with a warning message appearing in the MessageBox area stating that you are leaving 
the game.

Checkpoints;
1. Define a word list on the code side. When the game starts, choose a random word from this list.
2. Let "__" lines appear on the screen equal to the length of the word.
3. Print the word length on the screen.
4. Define clues for each word. (Example: “phone” – “it is used to communicate”)
5. Let the incorrectly guessed letters be printed on the screen.
6. Show MessageBox alerts (Win / Lose / End Game)
7. The pictures should be updated according to the incorrect prediction.
8. When the user wins, the application background color changes to green, and when the user 
loses, it changes to red.
9. Add a "Settings" button to the start screen. When you click this button, the game 
settings form page will open.
10. There should be a select category field in the open form. ListBox or ComboBox may be 
preferred. Each word has a category. Edit your existing code to make it categories.

11. Level selection should be made using the RadioButton as Easy-Medium-Hard. The level 
is determined by word length.
12. The user should be able to choose whether the game is timed or unlimited. The game 
should start indefinitely by default.
13. There is a clue for each word. The hint button on the game screen should not be 
displayed when the user selects the "show hint" option.
14. When you click the Save button, you should return to the starting screen. Unless the 
settings are changed, the game should be played according to what is selected.
